# Othello-Reversi

Develop a console-only Othello (Reversi) game in Python individually that uses tkinter library to build a GUI (game board) that users can directly play on. The project aims to practice studentsâ€™ tkinter skills, as the color of the disks on the game board changed from time to time.
